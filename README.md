# GenAI Product Finder
It's the ultimate utility tool for seamless product discovery while watching videos. Simply activate our utility tool while streaming on platforms like Netflix, and instantly access product information from the video. From the actor's attire to the gadgets they use, discover and explore similar recommendations effortlessly. Revolutionize your viewing experience with GenAI Product Finder, bridging the gap between entertainment and commerce.

It's MVP, but later I can add multiple features like Google My Business to suggest local listings to purchase the product from the nearest region.
